      <h1>Project<br>Brief</h1>


      <article>
        <p>
          This project will focus on accessibility in gaming by demonstrating methods to broaden gaming audiences by changing the physical abilities needed to play. This game will be a fantasy space-exploration game, where the player plays the role of captain.
          Instead of traditional control schemes requiring hand or body motion, the game will be controlled entirely with voice commands. In the game, the player will be confronted with a series of challenges. Using predetermined voice commands as 'orders'
          for your crew and ship, the player will overcome hostile environments, free enemies, and help make the universe a better places. I hope to create an inspiring experience that doesn't sacrifice fun for accessibility.

        <p>
          The target audience for this game is two-fold. It primarily is targeted at people interested in playing games who are physically disabled in some way, and therefore cannot use a traditional control scheme. The goal is to create an experience that is naturally
          accesible to anyone who can talk, without feeling forced or making sacrifices. A voice control scheme enables exactly that, by creating a natural flow of gameplay that is loyal to the subject material. The game is also intended for anyone interested
          in role-playing games or science fiction.

        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          As mentioned in the previous section, the goal is to create a seamless experience for differently abled people, without making compromises in the gameplay. Gameplay will be identical, no matter how the player may be differently abled. This will be accomplished
          using JavaScript libraries that enable the use of voice commands. These commands can also be used with variables, as long as the variable names are recognizable words. The player will be able to make a wide variety of orders at any time, such
          as "Shields up" or "Fire on the fourth moon".
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          It will be a simulated, immersive experience for commanding a fantasy spaceship, with sound, visual effects, and a heads-up display. The game world will be viewed through a GUI that not only portrays the setting of a fantasy ship, but also provides information
          about the ship to the player. The imagery will be futuristic and created with 3D models. The majority of the screen will be taken up by the "windshield" of the ship, which will provide a view out into space and allow the player to view the current
          situation and understand the options available.
        </p>
