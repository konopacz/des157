          Illustration is just one small part in a larger conversation about the media we consume every day. To better understand the problem, it is advantageous to examine how these problems play out on our culture’s biggest stage: Hollywood. As the most widely
          consumed form of media in America, large-scale filmmaking sets an example for representation and diversity for all other kinds of creative productions. Diversity, both within the producers of media and the characters within the media themselves,
          continue to be plagued with underrepresentation and statistical plateaus. In Dr. Stacy Smith’s annual analysis of popular films, she and her team broke down representation in 900 top films numerically, categorically defining types of representation
          and examining their trends in recent films over the last few years. Her work points out some small improvements in the past decade, with minor increases in female and LGBT representation in moviemaking. However, Hollywood has failed to address
          the systemic problems that plague the industry. For example, women play a critically low role in the production of movies in general. Female directors of popular films are in the single digits, and other roles see similar problems. Non-white
          people are also statistically underrepresented, with white actors filling over 75% of roles. Dr. Smith suggests some problems, like lower numbers of female leads, can be gradually fixed with smaller changes, such as increasing the number of
          films starring female leads by 5 every year, very quickly leading to equality. <br>In contrast, Anna Goodson examines some positive examples of diversity in illustration in her article, “A Look at Diversity in Illustration.” Here she
          samples the work of an incredible selection of artists, and showcases their ability to draw outside the lines of race, culture, and ethnicity. For example, on illustration showcases some “plus-size” woman swimming at the beach, with a clear
          message of accepting one another with our differences at the forefront. Another selected piece is a drawing of an Asian restaurant, featuring a white guest with blue hair in the foreground. Goodson also highlights the changes in diversity in
          illustration from 1960 to today, when popular media and advertising would rarely depict anyone outside of the the typical white nuclear family. Goodson makes a point that the world looks different today, and that she “can count on illustrators
          to deliver relevant, up-to-date content that reflects the world as it is.<br> In the article “The Art of Diversity: A CBC Panel,” author Matia Burnett describes a panel dedicated to discussing the issue of diversity within children’s book illustrations.
          Members of the panel were invited to share “experiences that have helped to formulate their understanding about ‘inclusion and sensitivity’ in their work.” Author Selina Alko stated she drew inspiration on this topic from her own multiracial
          household. However, she, and several others, pointed out what a complicated issue identity can be, and even well-intentioned and well-researched work can quickly be criticized and rejected if even a small misstep is made. One author who also
          served as an editor said she frequently reminds her illustrators to “be mindful of diversity as they create their books. Some of them, however, worry that their style of art might make their representations of characters of different ethnicities
          come across as caricatures. Therefore, she approaches each project on a case-by-case basis: ‘I want the artist to be comfortable,’ she said.” Depicting races, cultures, and ethnicities is especially difficult if the artist or author is not a
          part of those groups themselves. The panel discussed whether or not creators should step outside their own identities when it comes to depictions of diversity, and it was agreed that this was a necessary allowance. This opens up children’s books
          to criticism of cultural appropriation or worse, as authenticity can quickly be lost.
