          The Diverse Book Finder is a project developed at Bates College in the Spring of 2017. It is a tool designed to help curators of children's books locate titles that met certain conditions, most often pertaining to diversity (in the most general sense).
          For example, one can search the tool for books that fall under the "Any Child" category, which means it will depict characters or people of diverse backgrounds without having race or skin tone play a role in the story itself. Other parameters
          can be used to search for books about certain cultures, disabilities, and other things. The aim of the site is to help kids find books that are both representative of themselves and also interesting. This tool is a strong model as it is a powerful
          way to connect users with books that they may never have found otherwise.

          GoComics is an online resource for searching, reading, and categorizing recurring comic strips and cartoons. It contains both well-known comic strips published in newspapers as well as smaller, independent webcomics. Users can search for comics they know,
          browse lists of new comics to discover, and click through different collections. GoComics offers a feature to paying users that allows them to curate a selection of their personally preferred comics for daily viewing. This allows users to cultivate
          their own ultimate comics page, updated every day. This site is inspirational as it demonstrates the power of the web when it comes to personalizing and updating classic experiences, like reading the newspaper funnies section.
