          This first storyboard details the arc of need, discovery, and payoff for this project. The feedback I received pushed me to think more closely about how the user might discover my project in the first place, and I realized this was heavily dependant on
          the website being quickly discoverable via a web search. My potential audience members will not be able to use traditional navigation methods, so it is important to understand they will find the site with voice or other methods.

          This second storyboard is more specific about the motivations of the user and their end goal. I took into consideration what I learned from the previous iteration, and was careful to consider the path of the user. The feedback I received for this version
          suggested that I should be sure to be as inclusive as possible to different hardware setups and be sympathetic to different types of physical disabilities.
